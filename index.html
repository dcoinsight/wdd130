        <p>Hello! My name is David and i love codding. Also i love to dance which is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space. Through dance, a person can express an idea or emotion, release energy, or simply take delight in the movement itself. Dance can be performed by anyone, young or old, around the world. Dance can also be a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few.</p>
